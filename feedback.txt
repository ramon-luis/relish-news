Looks great!  Just one tip: you might want to keep your API keys
out of the source code, and use environment variables instead.
If we don't get to that topic in time, feel free to reach out to
Rachel for how to move your API keys out of the source code.

(With a private repo it might not be an issue, but if the repo
were to accidentally become public, someone else could snoop on your
repository and get you API key.)
